🌾 AgroSahayak – Empowering Agriculture Through Technology
AgroSahayak is a smart agriculture platform designed to assist farmers with real-time monitoring, AI-powered crop recommendations, and efficient resource management. Built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Machine Learning models, the application offers a one-stop solution to promote sustainable and data-driven farming practices.

🚀 Features
📊 Soil Analysis – Analyze soil health using key parameters and sensor data.

🌱 Crop Recommendation – Recommends optimal crops using a Random Forest model (achieving 99% accuracy).

📅 Crop Planning – Season-wise guidance for better yield planning.

🐛 Pest & Disease Recognition – Detects plant diseases using image-based AI and suggests chemical and biological treatments.

🛒 Agri Store – Buy, sell, or rent farm equipment.

📰 Bulletin Board – Updates on government schemes, news, and workshops.

🌐 Community Hub – Connects farmers with peers and agri-experts.

📈 Market Trends – Real-time pricing data for informed selling decisions.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js (Planned)

AI/ML: Python (Random Forest for crop recommendation, ResNet50 for image classification)

Deployment: (Coming Soon)
